# Work-Examples
Examples of my technical experience in Data Science and Software Development!

1. `Studying Data Access Patterns Using dCache Logs.pdf`: The poster I created for the midway point of my research project, where I used EDA and Neural Networks to attempt to increase the efficiency of a caching system.
2. `research-poster.pdf`: The poster my team created when attempting to create a new database of Irish plays, in order to test training a LLM on antiquated datasets.
3. `h&a_presentation_AI.PNG`: My work which was featured in a quarterly company conference on Artificial Intelligence.
